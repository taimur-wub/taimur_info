    <!-- Main bio -->
    <div class="about-content">
      <p>
        I am <strong>Taimur Rahman</strong>, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil Engineering at the
        World University of Bangladesh, Dhaka. My work sits at the intersection of
        <strong>structural engineering</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>, with a focus on turning
        complex analytical models and heterogeneous data into reliable tools for engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research spans <strong>fundamental period models for RC and steel braced RC buildings</strong>,
        <strong>masonry infilled frames</strong>, and
        <strong>probabilistic ML frameworks for UHPC and advanced concretes</strong>.
        I develop interpretable stacked ensembles, LightGBM and NGBoost models, and
        deep symbolic regression based expressions that complement structural mechanics,
        rather than replace it. The goal is simple:
        <strong>code compatible, transparent models that improve seismic assessment and design decisions.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In parallel, I teach core structural engineering courses, supervise undergraduate theses,
        serve on editorial and review boards, and lead initiatives that bring data driven thinking
        into everyday academic and professional practice. I am particularly interested in
        collaborations that link <strong>numerical simulation, experimental work, and ML</strong>
        for practical, deployable solutions in developing and seismic-prone regions.
